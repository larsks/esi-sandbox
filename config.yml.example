# The playbooks assume that interface "eth1" will be used to host the
# provisioning network.  You can select another interface here:
standalone_interface: eth1

# The playbooks define to using 192.168.23.0/24 for the provisioning
# network, but you can select a differe network here.  All other ip
# addresses are generated from this variable (see
# roles/config/defaults/main.yml for details).
standalone_subnet: 192.168.23.0/24

# If you need to add additional arguments to the `openstack tripleo deploy`
# command, you can set `extra_deploy_args` here. This will be added *after*
# the default deploy arguments.
extra_deploy_args:
  - "-e ./override-neutron-containers.yaml"

# Tripleo master defaults to using the OVN mechanism driver for Neutron. Ironic
# requires the `baremetal` driver as well, so the default list of mechanisms is
# `[ovn, baremetal]`. If you want to use the legacy openvswitch driver instead,
# you can change the setting here.
neutron_mechanism_drivers:
  - openvswitch
  - baremetal
